Had trouble with my local storage adding to one button. Received help through ask BCS, one fix, i was putting my entire array in the buttons.
I also received helped with the boxes. Seemed to have forgot a little of css and finally used flexbox correctly. This assignment forces you to do that. 
Received help from Anthony via Slack about the APIs. 
Everything else i had trouble with i fixed myself. 
Good assignment, i liked it.
